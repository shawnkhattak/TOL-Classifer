# Enemy detector for Tales of Landor - WIP

An Image detection model trained using YOLOv8, made to find different enemies in the game Tales of Landor.

The purpose of training this model was to teach myself the very basics of machine learning and training image detection/tracking models.
Ever since I was a child, I've been fascinated by YouTube videos showcasing advanced machine learning experiments, where teams of scientists teach AI to walk or run. I've always dreamed of working on such projects, but I lacked the understanding of key conceptsâ€”until now.

I used Python to gather data, label it, and train a model to detect hostile creatures in the pre-alpha indie game "Tales of Landor: MMO." 
I plan to tackle more complex and real-life applicable projects in the future, with a goal of eventually exploring machine learning in physics simulations.
